    It should be only 450px wide
    It should be center aligned to the body
    It should have a white background so that users can
    clearly separate the content space from the "gutter" or "
    curtains" of the page.

Tip: Add some temporary content like paragraphs or headings
 into main to see how it flows and that it aligns well vertically.
Task 2: Fix content behind the nav

Once you follow the tip above, you'll realize that the c
ontent within the main element is being clipped by the fixed header.
How can you push it down (say 140px), again with only a CSS change to the main element?*/
